User lands on hero section → views animated skill badges → scrolls through project showcase → filters projects by category → opens project details in modal → reads testimonials → contacts via form or calendar booking → downloads resume via floating action button.

**Performance Flow:**
Page load → critical CSS renders immediately → lazy load images on scroll → service worker caches assets → structured data improves SEO → analytics tracks user interactions → A/B testing optimizes conversion.
