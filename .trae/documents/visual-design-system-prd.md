## 3. Core Process

### Main User Flow

Users begin their journey on the homepage where they encounter an immersive particle background system with floating 3D elements. The glassmorphism navigation bar provides smooth transitions between sections. As users scroll, viewport intersection observers trigger smooth animations that reveal content progressively.

When exploring projects, users interact with flip animation cards that reveal detailed information on hover. The filter system uses morphing buttons with dynamic background patterns that respond to user selections. Video showcases feature custom player controls with chapter navigation and quality selection.

The contact process utilizes glassmorphism form fields with micro-interaction validation feedback. Floating action buttons provide quick access to key actions throughout the site. All interactions are enhanced with particle effects and 3D transforms that create depth and engagement.
