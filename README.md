    The purpose of this portfolio is to provide real-time examples of my developing skills as I progress through the curriculum, and to save these digital examples for posterity so that they may be accessed later upon my release. All code within has been written bu myself, but many snippets are examples from the copious materials I have been given access to for reference. This includes, but is not limited to:

    1. My favorite source, offline or otherwise is, [DevDocs](https://devdocs.tlm.cloud)
    2. Second only to [MDN Web Docs](https://mdn.tlm.cloud/en-US/docs/)
    3. Lastly, my tattered, much perused copy of: *Coding All-in-One For Dummies, Wiley & Sons 2017* which has seen copious hours of use in preparation for this class.
